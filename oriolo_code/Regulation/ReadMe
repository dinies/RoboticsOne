Enter the initialization parameters in init.m (simulation time, initial configuration of the unicycle, gains of the controller). The destination is the origin of the cartesian plane (for cartesian_reg) or of the configuration space (for posture_reg). A translation can always be performed in advance to place the destination at any desired point.

Then open the desired .mdl, double-click the “initialization” block, run the simulation, then double-click the “plots” block
